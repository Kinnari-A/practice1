In the U.S., Day of the Dead is becoming big business.

Dancers march the parade route, as Oklahoma City's Plaza District celebrates its third annual Day of the Dead Festival, October 30, 2016, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Dia de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead, is a Latin American holiday honoring the deceased. One thing that often stands out to so many unfamiliar with the holiday is the calavera makeup look that resembles a human skull. 
Chucho Rodriguez works his fingers to the bone around this time of year. His business as a tattoo artist in Lockport, Illinois, always picks up in October, because customers want skulls. Lots of skulls.

Lately, though, people are forgoing tattoos of the kinds of skulls associated with pirates, haunting and Halloween. Instead, they ask for tattoos of decorated sugar skulls adorned with flowers.

That's because of growing interest in the Day of the Dead — or Dia de los Muertos — the Mexican holiday that celebrates the lives of deceased friends and family. These distinctive sugar skulls play a prominent role in the celebration.</p>
